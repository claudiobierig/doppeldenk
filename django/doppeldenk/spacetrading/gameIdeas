TODO:

Change main board (2h)
- change how hexes are coloured

Remodel Image (1h)
- image includes data
- image includes size, width

Generate planet board (4h)
- generate symbol

First set of rules without examples, etc. (2h)

create code that generates printing material (8h)

svg module so it can be used to generate templates
- Remove unused stuff
- Create plan, what needs to be set
- Do this step by step for everything that is implemented in Django


Django
- Create db entries for 4 Users
- Create Login/Create/Join/Active pages
- Remodel current python code to create a template, which displays current game status
 - Add market and playerboards
- Add forms
- Somehow work with clicking in the svgs instead of a form



Which pages are needed
x Login
- Create Game (form)
- Join Game (list of game_instances filtered, link to action join)
- List my active games (list of game_instances filtered, link to the game)
- Show special game
 - create svg from game_instance
  - create template
   - which parts need to be adaptive
 - form to perform next move

- Create models
 - game_instance
  - number_of_players (int)
  - players[4] (NULL possible)
  - planets[5]
  - get_next_player (return player)
  - next_move (int)
  - sort_of_move
  - state (waiting, running, finished)

 - planet
  - name (string)
  - number_of_hexes (int)
  - current_position (int)
  - buy_resources[5] (enum)
  - buy_resources_price[5] (int)
  - sell_resources[5] (enum)

All outdated
Bugs:
- 2nd round not working

Refactoring:


8h
- Refactoring
 x text needs a different id
 - remove any data from svg and into one js class, which can later be moved to db
  - values from class should only be used via getters/setters
 

4h
- show resources on wheel (random setup)
- deal with multiple resources on one spot

8h
- add js functionality
 - possibility to buy/sell
 - save somewhere if we traded a resource this round
 
8h
- add production and settlement events
 - production -> turn wheel
 - settlement: add cubes to wheel
 - add production and settlement events to timeline (4 player)

4h
different player count
html:
- possibility to choose number of players/ timeline accordingly
js:
- startingPosition needs to deactivate ships/markers which are not in play

8h
- prettify html
 - try bootstrap
 - startpage only with button and number of players
 - get svgs for ships (serenity, millenium falk, bsg, enterprise)
 - get planet images in active hexes

8h
- add history

4h
- hover: show time needed to this planet

80h
- add database


Draft Tiles, which will be puzzled in a second phase, repeat.
Place Meeple/Dice to activate or improve tiles.


Wincondition: Most money, tie breaker: finished last
Game End: 3 rounds


Every one starts with one ship, at one starting planet, one starting contract, resources, starting money
Timeline as in teben for each ship
one turn:
- buy resource at the current planet (increase time by resources/crewmembers)
- fly to different planet (increase time depending on ship and distance)
- fullfill contract (choose contract from open contracts (increase time depending on contract or resources/crewmembers)

Events happening when time has passed (at the end of a subturn):
- drafting
- production on all planets
- planets move around the sun
- settlement


Cards:
- ships (differ in speed, cargohall, crew) (skip at start to simplify: speed ?, cargo 6, crew 1)
- contracts (resources, payment (stoneage hut mechanism to start, resources 3-8), time(#resources), planet)
- planets
- resources


Bord setup:
Draw 3 different planets and 3 different resources. Each planet will produce one of the resources. Cost at the beginning at 1/2/3/4/5/6.
Place 6 contracts open next to the bord (cost 0,0,0,1,2,4)


Start with 3 ships, 3 contracts, 3 planets, 6 resources in drafting hand
keep 1 ship, 1 contract, 1 planet, 2 resources
place shipmarker on planet, resources into cargohall of ship, keep contract hidden,
pass rest to net player

Buying:
- Any number of resources that fits into the cargohall at the current price.
- For each type of resource increase price of corresponding resource by one

Flying:
- just count the difference and divide by speed rounded up

Contract:
- pay the resources, get the money, take a new contract from open contracts 


Events:
- draft:
  take one ship, one planet, one contract, two resources. place the ship on the planet and discard the cards
  place the time marker of the ship on the drafting spot (which order?)
- production:
  Increase price by #round for all resources (happen at different times for #players)
- planets move around:
  each planet moves in different speed around the sun
- settlement:
  draw a planet and a resource. this planet will now produce this resource, price at the given starting cost. If the planet already produces this resource place a second marker on the track. when buying only one marker is increased


Open Ideas:
- maybe some buildings, action cards, ship improvements
- global goals such as #contracts on different planets
