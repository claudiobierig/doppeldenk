<h2>4. Gameplay</h2>
If it is a players turn he performs the actions b), c) and d), where b) and c) are optional and d) is mandatory.
<div class="card mt-3">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">a) Determining who's turn it is</h4>
The next turn will be performed from the player who has progressed the least on the timeline.<br>
As tiebreaker it is the player who's timemarker is on top.<br>
If an event is the next player after this consideration, the event will be performed and the next player is determined after the same rules.
</div></div>
<div class="card mt-3">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">b) Trading</h4>
If the players ship is located on a planet, the player may trade.
He can buy resources which are offered on the planet for the given price and sell resources that are demanded for the given price.
The cost of each resource, which was bought/sold at least once is decreased/increased by one.
</div></div>
<div class="card mt-3">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">c) Bribe</h4>
If the player traded at least one resource, he may pay one money to increase his influence on the politians on this planet by one.
For each additional space that a player wishes to move along the influence track, he must pay the value shown on the space he moves to.
</div></div>
<div class="card mt-3">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">d) Flying to another position</h4>
The active player chooses and destination hex, which is different from the current position.<br>
The timemarker is increased by the distance of the hex to the current position plus two.<br>
If another timemarker is already at this space the marker is placed on top.<br><br>
Alternatively a player may pass and end the game (only for himself). This only makes sense at the end of the game.
</div></div>
<div class="card mt-3">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">e) Events</h4>
<h5>e*) Planet movement</h5>
All planets move counterclockwise by one space. If there were any ships on the planet, they move with the planet.
Afterwards the marker is moved forward by 10 spots.
<h5>e**) Adjust offer and demant</h5>
All planet market boards are moved to the right by one spot, i.e. the price for the offered resources decreases by one and for the demanded resources increases by one.
Afterwards the marker is moved forward by 40, 30, 25, 20 (TODO) spot for 1, 2, 3, 4 players respectively.

<h2>5. Open Ideas</h2>
<div class="card mt-3">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">a) Additional events</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Settlement: Add new offer and demant tokens to a planet</li>
    <li>Political event cards</li>
    <li>Additional ship</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="card mt-3">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">b) Ship improvements</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Additional storage</li>
    <li>Faster</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="card mt-3">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">c) Alternative trading</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Storage: Only a max. number of each resource instead of a total max.</li>
    <li>Prices are somehow managed by actually placing/taking resources from the market.</li>
    <li>No selling on planets. Instead one politician can be bribed represented by a card. The bribe costs money, resources, time and gives you VPs, money, resources or anything else that may come along.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
