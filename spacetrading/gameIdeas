Wincondition: Most money, tie breaker: finished last
Game End: 3 rounds


Every one starts with one ship, at one starting planet, one starting contract, resources, starting money
Timeline as in teben for each ship
one turn:
- buy resource at the current planet (increase time by resources/crewmembers)
- fly to different planet (increase time depending on ship and distance)
- fullfill contract (choose contract from open contracts (increase time depending on contract or resources/crewmembers)

Events happening when time has passed (at the end of a subturn):
- drafting
- production on all planets
- planets move around the sun
- settlement


Cards:
- ships (differ in speed, cargohall, crew) (skip at start to simplify: speed ?, cargo 6, crew 1)
- contracts (resources, payment (stoneage hut mechanism to start, resources 3-8), time(#resources), planet)
- planets
- resources


Bord setup:
Draw 3 different planets and 3 different resources. Each planet will produce one of the resources. Cost at the beginning at 1/2/3/4/5/6.
Place 6 contracts open next to the bord (cost 0,0,0,1,2,4)


Start with 3 ships, 3 contracts, 3 planets, 6 resources in drafting hand
keep 1 ship, 1 contract, 1 planet, 2 resources
place shipmarker on planet, resources into cargohall of ship, keep contract hidden,
pass rest to net player

Buying:
- Any number of resources that fits into the cargohall at the current price.
- For each type of resource increase price of corresponding resource by one

Flying:
- just count the difference and divide by speed rounded up

Contract:
- pay the resources, get the money, take a new contract from open contracts 


Events:
- draft:
  take one ship, one planet, one contract, two resources. place the ship on the planet and discard the cards
  place the time marker of the ship on the drafting spot (which order?)
- production:
  Increase price by #round for all resources (happen at different times for #players)
- planets move around:
  each planet moves in different speed around the sun
- settlement:
  draw a planet and a resource. this planet will now produce this resource, price at the given starting cost. If the planet already produces this resource place a second marker on the track. when buying only one marker is increased


Open Ideas:
- maybe some buildings, action cards, ship improvements
- global goals such as #contracts on different planets
